# Makers BnB challenge

Working as a team of 4, we are creating a BnB web app that allows users to list spaces, and hire spaces.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Installing

Run npm install, and then npm start to start the server.

Alternatively you can go to "makers-project.xyz".

## User Story's
Users should be able to name their space, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night.

Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night.

Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space.

Any signed-up user can list a new space.

Any signed-up user can request to hire any space for one night, and this should be approved by the user that owns that space.

Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available.
